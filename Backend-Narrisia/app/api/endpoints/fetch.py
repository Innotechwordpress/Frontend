        You are a business analyst. Analyze the email below and provide a comprehensive JSON response with realistic estimates.

        Company: {company_name}
        Email from: {sender}
        Subject: {subject}
        Body: {body[:1000]}

        CRITICAL: You must provide realistic estimates for ALL financial fields. Never use "N/A", "Unknown", null, or 0 for market_cap and funding_status.

        Guidelines for estimates:
        - Large tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Indeed, Stripe): market_cap: 50000000000-500000000000, funding_status: "Public"
        - Medium companies (Internshala, Naukri, Krish Technolabs): market_cap: 100000000-5000000000, funding_status: "Series B/C" or "Private"
        - Small companies/startups: market_cap: 10000000-100000000, funding_status: "Series A/Seed" or "Bootstrap"
        - Revenue should be 10-20% of market cap typically

        For credibility scores: Well-known companies (90-95), Medium companies (75-85), Small companies (60-75).

        IMPORTANT: Write a detailed, accurate company summary based on what you know about the company. Do NOT use generic templates.

        Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
        {{
          "company_analysis": {{
            "company_name": "{company_name}",
            "industry": "Technology",
            "credibility_score": 85,

          "company_gist": "Write a detailed, specific summary about what this company actually does, their main products/services, their market position, and key business focus. Be specific and accurate - do not use generic templates.",
          "intent_confidence": 0.9
        }}

        MANDATORY: Provide realistic numerical estimates for market_cap (in dollars) and specific funding_status. Do not use placeholder text.
